<td><p><font size="5px">Kurukshetra is a city in the Indian state of Haryana. It is also known as Dharmakshetra ("Holy Place") and as the "Land of the Bhagavad Gita". The Kurukshetra War of the Mahabharata is said to have taken place there.

According to the Puranas, Kurukshetra is a region named after King Kuru, the ancestor of Kauravas and Pandavas, as depicted in epic Mahabharata. The importance of the place is attributed to the fact that the Kurukshetra War of the Mahabharata is said to have taken place here. Thaneswar whose urban area is merged with Kurukshetra is a pilgrimage site with many locations attributed to Mahabharata.

In most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not described as a city but a region ("kshetra" means "region" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra correspond roughly to the central and western parts of the state of Haryana and southern Punjab. According to the Taittiriya Aranyaka 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in Sirhind, Punjab), north of Khandava (Delhi and Mewat region), east of Maru (desert), and west of Parin.</font></p></td></tr>

<td><p><font size="5px">According to the Puranas, ancient Hindu texts, the region is named after King Kuru of the Bharata dynasty, who is also the ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas. These texts also tell that the battle of Mahabharata was fought on this land.

As the Vamana Purana describes, King Kuru chose land at the banks of Sarasvati River (dried up before 1900 BCE)[5] for embedding spirituality with eight virtues: austerity (Tapas), truth (Satya), forgiveness (Kshama), kindness (Daya), purity (Shuddha), charity (Daana), devotion (Yajna), and conduct (Brahmacharya). Lord Vishnu was impressed with the acts of King Kuru and blessed him with two boons�first, that this land forever will be known as a Holy Land after his name as Kurukshetra (the land of Kuru); second that anyone dying on this land will go to heaven.

The land of Kurukshetra was situated between two rivers�the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati.

This land has also been known as Uttarvedi, Brahmavedi, and Dharamkshetra at different periods. When King Kuru came on this land it was called Uttarvedi. Kurukshetra reached the zenith of its progress during the reign of King Harsha, during which Chinese scholar Xuanzang visited Thanesar</font></p></td></tr>
