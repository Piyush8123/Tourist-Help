Assam covers an area of 78,438 km2 (30,285 sq mi). The state is bordered by Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh to the north; Nagaland and Manipur to the east; Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Bangladesh to the south; and West Bengal to the west via the Siliguri Corridor, a 22 kilometres (14 mi) strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India. <br>Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. The state was the first site for oil drilling in Asia.[10] Assam has conserved the one-horned Indian rhinoceros from near extinction, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy hog, tiger and various species of Asiatic birds, and provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife tourism to Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park, which are World Heritage Sites. Sal tree forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of India; this rain feeds the Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with a hydro-geomorphic environment.</font></p></td></tr>

<td><p><font size="5px">According to a late text, Kalika Purana (c. 9th�10th century AD), the earliest ruler of Assam was Mahiranga Danav of the Danava dynasty, which was removed by Naraka who established the Naraka dynasty. The last of these rulers, also Naraka, was slain by Krishna. Naraka's son Bhagadatta became the king, who (it is mentioned in the Mahabharata) fought for the Kauravas in the battle of Kurukshetra with an army of kiratas, chinas and dwellers of the eastern coast.

At the same time towards the east in central Assam, Asura Kingdom was ruled by indigenous Bodo-Kachari line of kings of Mariachi dynasty.<br><br><b>Ancient</b><br><br>Ambari site in Gwahati has revealed shunga Kushana era artefacts including flight of stairs and a water tank which may date from 1st century BC and may be 2,000 years old, experts speculate that Ambari was another significant find is Roman era Roman roulette pottery from the 2nd century BC.[22][23][24]Samudragupta's 4th century Allahabad pillar inscription mentions Kamarupa (Western Assam)[25] and Davaka (Central Assam)[26] as frontier kingdoms of the Gupta Empire.

Davaka was later absorbed by Kamarupa, which grew into a large kingdom that spanned from Karatoya river to near present Sadiya and covered the entire Brahmaputra valley, North Bengal, parts of Bangladesh and, at times Purnea and parts of West Bengal.[27]

The kingdom was ruled by three dynasties; the Varmanas (c. 350�650 CE), the Mlechchha dynasty (c.655�900 CE) and the Kamarupa-Palas (c. 900�1100 CE), from their capitals in present-day Guwahati (Pragjyotishpura), Tezpur (Haruppeswara) and North Gauhati (Durjaya) respectively. All three dynasties claimed descent from Narakasura.<br>

In the reign of the Varman king, Bhaskaravarman (c. 600�650 AD), the Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the region and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was extended to c. 1255 AD by the Lunar I (c. 1120�1185 AD) and Lunar II (c. 1155�1255 AD) dynasties.</font></p></td></tr>
