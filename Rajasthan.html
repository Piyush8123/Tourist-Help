It is the largest Indian state by area and the seventh largest by population. Rajasthan is located on the northwestern side of India, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the "Rajasthan Desert" and "Great Indian Desert") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by five other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest.<br>The state was formed on 30 March 1949 when Rajputana � the name adopted by the British Raj for its dependencies in the region[13] � was merged into the Dominion of India. Its capital and largest city is Jaipur. Other important cities are Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Ajmer, Alwar and Udaipur. The economy of Rajasthan is the ninth-largest state economy in India with ?9.24 lakh crore (US$130 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of ?108,000 (US$1,600). Rajasthan ranks 22nd among Indian states in human development index.</font></p></td></tr>
