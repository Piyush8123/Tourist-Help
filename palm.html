<td><p><font size="5px">Palampur is a hill station and a municipal council in the Kangra Valley in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It is surrounded by pine forests and flanked by the Dhauladhar ranges. The town derives its name from the local word palum, meaning lots of water. There are numerous streams flowing from the mountains to the plains from Palampur. The combination of greenery and water gives Palampur a distinctive look.<br><br>Palampur is an important city located in Kangra Valley. It is a famous hill station and was once a part of the Jalandhar kingdom. The town came into being when Dr. Jameson, Superintendent of Botanical Gardens, introduced the tea bush from Almora in 1849. The bush thrived and so did the town which became a focus of the European tea estate owners with an exception of the famous (former) Wah Tea Estate which was owned by Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan and his descendants, until 1947.[4] Since then, the Kangra tea of Palampur has been known internationally.

The first prime minister of independent India, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru visited Palampur in 1941 when it was still British India. There is a Nehru Chowk in Palampur to commemorate this event.<br><br><b>Pre Independence</b><br><br>During the second half of the 19th century, with success of tea estates in Palampur area, the original settlement started developing. In 1888, it was made a tehsil headquarter, by shifting the same from Bhawarna. The tea estate owners impressed upon the administration to bring infrastructure like St. Paul's School, colleges and hospital. It also became a centre of labourers engaged in plucking of tea leaves and packing, transportation and marketing thereof.

The earthquake of 1905 left a trail of destruction. Therefore, building style, projections and building material had to be modified. The tehsil complex, school and church towards T-Bud Hotel were built during British Period. Consequent upon laying of railway line for hydro-electric project at Joginder Nagar in 1927 and installation of railway station and staff quarters, construction activity grew fast. Increase in the employment, led to investment in the area, whereby multifarious development including roads took place.<br><br><b>Post Independence</b><br><br>n 1947, Sobha Singh, a well known contemporary painter moved from Punjab to Andretta and developed his art gallery. He painted world-famous art pieces related to Punjabi culture and shot into prominence as an artist. After 1946, the regional linkages of town started improving. A military station was established at Holta, a strategic location of the town. CSK Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University was established in which Dhauladhar Hostel was inaugurated on 15 March 1985 which proved to be the stepping stone of the universitie's success, besides the establishment of Indian Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) Complex (Institute of Himalyan Bioresource Technology).[5] Many offices at the level of sub division pertaining to Electricity, Housing Board, Public health and PWD (B&R) were located. Tourist accommodation like T-Bud Hotel by Himachal Tourism Development Corporation and other leisure hotels were constructed.</font></p></td></tr>
